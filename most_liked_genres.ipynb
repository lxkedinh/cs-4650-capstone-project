    "Some notes about the findings:\n",
    "- Rogue-likes are the most well-received genre by players. The genre is ahead by a lot more than the competition, beating second place (singleplayer) by 3.22%.\n",
    "- Massively Multiplayer games are the least well-received genre, losing to the next highest genre (MOBAs) by 4.16%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some constraints to consider when analyzing the results are:\n",
    "- Steam has a weird system for categorizing games. Their categorizing system is split between genres and tags. Genres are types of games that are officially recognized and listed as a category you can search by on Steam. On the other hand, there are tags which are user-defined and players can assign games tags that they feel belong to the game. The game then belongs to the tags that are most assigned by players. Since tags are user-defined, our results could be skewed because game categorization by tag is subjective by the players of that game, not officially by Steam itself.\n",
    "- The majority of video games in existence don't just belong to one genre. Our results could be skewed because of some games that are very popular and belong to multiple genres. Or, there could be the case where a game isn't as popular in one genre as it is in another genre that the game belongs in."
